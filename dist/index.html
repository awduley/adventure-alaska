        <h4 class="heading-quaternary margin-sm">For all of you outdoor enthusiasts. We have you covered.</h4>
        <p>We get it. We've been doing this for nearly 40 years. It's in our blood.
          It's a way of life. And when you're here in Alaska, you either go big or you 
          go home. 
        </p>
        <h4 class="heading-quaternary margin-sm">If you're looking for kayaking excursions, look no further.</h4>
        <p>Whether you just want to do a little sightseeing on a relaxing 
          half day trip, or you're looking for a multi-day kayak adventure
          camping on remote beaches and sleeping under the stars, our team 
          of professional guides will get you where you want to go.
        </p>
        <h4 class="heading-quaternary margin-sm">We offer flightseeing trips, bear viewing, and remote drop offs</h4>
        <p>Alaska is vast, why not see it from a thousand feet up? We love 
          taking folks up to see the sprawling glaciers, the endless fjords, and 
          especially the mighty brown bears!</p> 
          
        <p>And if you're the brave type, we even offer flyin fishing trips
          and remote drop offs if you just want to get away from it all and 
          relax and unwind for a bit in the great outdoors.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-quaternary margin-sm">Are you looking to bag a record breaking halibut or try your hand at landing
          a monster salmon shark?
        </h4>
        <p>Our chartars will take you out to the serious fishing grounds. Don't waste 
          hour time in the bay, it's been fished out for years. Let us show you where
          the real fish are at.
        </p>
        <p>Our boats are outfitted with top of the line gear and safety features, and our
          captains have a combined experience of over seventy-five years. They'll get you 
          that fish no matter what.

        <p>"Let me tell you what, they weren't kidden about haulen in a record halibut. I'ma start from the beginning aright.
          We left the harbor at just about 5 after, and then we hauled a** over to the fishen grounds.
          It took us oh...maybe an hour or so to get there. But once we were there man, let me tell you. Whew!
        </p>
        <p>
          The crew hopped into action quicker than a fat kid eaten a Snickers bar. Anyways they got everybody stringed and baited and ready to go!
          I tell you what. I got my first hit in literally 5 minutes. The fight was on. I was pumped like a Reebok.
        </p> 
        <p>Fast forward 3 hours and I was pullen in the biggest darn fish of my life. I was beat. After we finally managed to get that monster in the boat,
          it weighed in at a hefty 89 lbs. Keep up the good work Adventure Alaska. By far the best charter service I've ever been on. Aint no such thing as a charter 
          in Kentucky, but whatever. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The captain and the crew where all top notch. They delivered on their promises..actually I would even say they over delivered! 
          I highly recommend these guys. If you're looken to catch a fish bigger than cousin Bubba's beer belly, this is the place man."

          "Oh my gosh...where do I even start. So I went on the half day kayak trip, and it was <strong>AMAZING</strong>!. Like, I highly recommend it to anyone. We stayed close to...wait, I totally forgot. My girlfriend
          Chastity and her boyfriend Trent, totally forgot to bring their selfie sticks! I know, what where they going to do right? It's like, sorry Instregram, like we totally dropped the ball on this one. Chastity was a bit shaken about
          the whole ordeal, but she pushed on like a champ. I feel so bad for her and her followers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, shortly after we set out, oh yeah we did the noon to four trip, because who gets up at eight in the morning right? I don't think so. 
          I need time in the morning to check Facebook and drink my double Ristretto venti half-soy nonfat decaf organic chocolate brownie iced vanilla double-shot pumpkin spice frappuccino extra hot with foam whipped cream upside down double blended morning coffee...thing.
        </p> 
        <p> 
          What was I talking about? Oh yeah. So we stop at this absolutely gorgeous waterfall and we get out of our kayaks. Well it was really more of a 
          falling type motion. But anyway, we got to walk up and actually touch the waterfall! It must have been like tens of hundreds of feet tall. And the water was like...sooooooooooo cold. I'm not even kidding.
          It must have been like, below zero? I'm not good with temperatures, but believe me it was cold! I don't know how Alaskans live here. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, we went on and did some more kayaking and by the end my shoulders 
          where killing me! In a good way though. If you're up here in Homer visiting like we are, you have to give Adventure Alaska a try. I believe they have fish hunting trips, and uhm flighty sighty excursions, and of course 
          the kayaking which we did. YEAH!

          "Due to the fact that I live in Fairbanks, working fifty hours a week in a secret underground base building hypersonic displacer
          modules capable of edge of space flight, I don't get the chance to go fishing for hippoglossus stenolepis as often as I would like. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that I'm on vacation, I thought it prudent to do something as a family. So we put it up for a vote. I opted to take a trip to Scotland to find the Loch New monster. My son desired to tour a macoroni &amp; cheese factory in Brussels, purchase 7 kg 
          of Reese's peanut butter cups, and play Minecraft for seven days straight. My wife wished to go clam digging in Clam Gulch, rent a cabin for the week, and make seven
          different meals with nothing but moose meat and fiddlehead ferns. In the end, my wife won. She says I voted for her but I don't think I did. I would have remembered that.
        </p> 
        <p> 
          I wasn't going to let this ruin my chance at having a good time though. So I did what any sane person would do. I wrote a computer program to compare the quality score of Adventure Alaska with other known companies in the area
          against verious metrics. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In conlusion, I can confidently recommend Adventure Alaska with a degree of certinity just under 99.5%. 99.45837263% to be exact. Perhaps during my next vacation in fours years time, we will return and 
          experience the Ursus arctos viewing flightseeing package. I know I can '<em>bear-ly</em>' wait."

          "J'aime cette entreprise. Oui, ils sont assez bons dans ce qu'ils font. J'aime voler. Et nous avons volé. Nous avons volé haut. Au-dessus des montagnes. Nous avions une vue magnifique sur la baie de Kachemak, et c'était magnifique. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Il y avait des ours. Grands ours bruns. Vraiment merveilleux. Je referais ça n'importe quel jour. Je ne pense pas qu'il y ait une meilleure entreprise dans tout Homer. Les avions sont confortables et les casques fonctionnent très bien.
        </p> 
        <p> 
          Le pilote et le guide étaient très compétents. Ils étaient sympathiques et ont souligné de nombreux points de repère et ont même fait quelques blagues. Et surtout, ils parlaient un peu le français. C'était magnifique.
        </p>
        <p>
          En résumé, je recommande fortement cette entreprise à tous ceux qui cherchent à faire de l'aventure dans l'incroyable péninsule de Kenai. Ça vaut chaque centime. Et quand vous êtes ici à Homer, assurez-vous d'essayer les magasins locaux du centre-ville. Tout le monde est tellement sympathique!
